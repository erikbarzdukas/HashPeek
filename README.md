Hash Peek
=========

This is the early stage of a project to build a Twitter hashtag visualizer. The end goal is to have a site that takes 
a hashtag or other filter from the user, hits the Twitter streaming API with it, and returns geolocation data on
the resulting tweets. Geolocation data will then be presented to the user graphically.


Status
------
Currently the project is paused. Fewer tweets have geolocation data then I planned for. 


To Do
------
- [CHECK] Have ability to connect to Twitter streaming API.
- [CHECK] Be able to pull down available geolocation info.
- [] Develop web frontend
- [] Design and implement appropriate visualization scheme
- [] ??? The unkown
